# Stroke Hospitalizations Across Texas Counties (Excel Dashboard Project)

**Have you ever wondered how stroke hospitalizations differ across Texas counties?** This project dives deep into those variations, focusing on hemorrhagic (bleeding) and ischemic (blockage) strokes. By analyzing data on stroke hospitalizations, regional trends, and risk factors, we can uncover important insights about healthcare resource distribution and outcomes across the state.

## Project Overview

This project used **Excel's advanced features** to visualize stroke hospitalization data across Texas counties, focusing on individuals aged 65 and older from 2018 to 2020. The data, pulled from the [Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke](https://nccd.cdc.gov/), includes both **hemorrhagic** and **ischemic** stroke types for all racial and ethnic groups.

### Excel Features Utilized:
- **Power Query**: Combined multiple data sources into one for analysis.
- **Combo Chart**: Visualized stroke rates across counties, highlighting Texas' state average.
- **Slicers**: Allowed interactive filtering of stroke data by county.
- **Dynamic Text Boxes**: Displayed key statistics about stroke cases dynamically.

### Key Visual Insights:
- Texas' average stroke hospitalization rate among Medicare beneficiaries is **11.8 per 1,000**, compared to the national average of **10.7 per 1,000**.
- Nearly **45%** of Texas counties have hospitalization rates above the state average.
- **87%** of strokes in Texas were ischemic (2,187 cases), and **13%** were hemorrhagic (341 cases).

## Data Sources
The stroke hospitalization data used in this project was sourced from:
- **Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke**: [https://nccd.cdc.gov/](https://nccd.cdc.gov/)

## Project Structure
- **All Stroke Data**: Stroke hospitalization rates for all strokes.
- **Ischemic Strokes**: Filtered data focusing on ischemic stroke rates.
- **Hemorrhagic Strokes**: Filtered data focusing on hemorrhagic stroke rates.
- **Combined Data**: A single, merged table containing data for all stroke types.

## How It Works
1. **Data Import**: Data was copied from the Interactive Atlas and organized into separate worksheets.
2. **Power Query**: Combined all stroke types into one comprehensive table for analysis.
3. **Visualizations**: A combo chart and dynamic slicer were added to allow users to explore stroke hospitalization data across counties.
4. **Dashboard Summary**: A key statistic textbox at the bottom summarizes the distribution of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in Texas.
